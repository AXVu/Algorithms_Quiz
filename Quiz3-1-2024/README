Analysis of DiagonalDifference
Time: This is O(n) or linear time, as I only loop through through
the array once. (technically the addition operations cost extra
depending on size of input ints but I don't think you want that)
Space: This has constant space or O(1) because I only use 3 extra
variable, all of which are ints, which do not depend on the size
of the input array.
